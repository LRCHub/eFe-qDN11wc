They made me put this suit on
And launched me into space
Left my life behind me
To change the human race
I'm moving at a pace

Dare to be a winner
Succeed in all you do
Take what life presents you

Ambition brought me here
A winner in my field
Dare to be aa winner
F9ind your fate is sealed
Hidden Truths revealed

How did I get here
Tell me what is my plan
I'm affected
This body of men aspire
Struggling through the wires
They're infected

How did I get here
Tell me what was your plan
I'm affected

This body of men aspire
Struggling through the wires
To achieve this
Stuck with their brick wall minds
One of another kind
To be human
